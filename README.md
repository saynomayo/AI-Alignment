# AI-Alignment
This project exists to create an AI model that is aligned with the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This project is mostly experimental and exists to showcase what a human aligned AI should look like, the risks that come with a misaligned AI, and how easily a misaligned AI can be realigned.
